## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements: 
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created:

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
#cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
def deal_card():
  """Returns a random card from the deck."""
  cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
  card = choice(cards)
  return card

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input 
#and returns the score. 
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.
def calculate_score(cards_list):
  """Take a list of cards and return the score calculated from the cards"""
  score = sum(cards_list)

  #Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.
  if score == 21 and len(cards_list) == 2:
    return 0
  
  #Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().
  if 11 in cards_list and score > 21:
    cards_list.remove(11)
    cards_list.append(1)
    score = sum(cards_list)

  return score

#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.
def compare(user_score, computer_score):
  if user_score == computer_score:
    return "Both you and the computer have the same score.\nIt's a draw!"
  elif user_score == 0:
    return "Wow! You got blackjack! You win!" 
  elif computer_score == 0:
    return "Aww! The computer got blackjack! You lose!"
  elif user_score > 21:
    return "Aww! You went over. You lose!"
  elif computer_score > 21:
    return "The computer went over. You win!"
  else:
    if user_score > computer_score:
     return f"You have a score of {user_score}.\nThe computer has a score of {computer_score}. You win!"
    else:
      return f"You have a score of {user_score}.\nThe computer has a score of {computer_score}. You lose!"

  #Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().
  #user_cards = []
  #computer_cards = []
  for i in range(0, 2):
    #NOTE: Use append not += when adding single items to a list. += is the same as extend, it must be adding a list.
